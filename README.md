- 👋 Hi, I’m @CodesignWorks. A software engineer and innovator who is passionate about using technology to make life better for everyone.
- 👀 I’m interested in all aspects of coding, from front-end development to back-end development to machine learning. I'm always looking for new challenges and new ways to use technology to solve real-world problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the latest trends in software engineering, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, also on minimalist design with code (CSS...) or with software (figma...).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects with other engineers who are passionate about building innovative products.
- 📫 You can reach me at git.codeanddesign@gmail.com
